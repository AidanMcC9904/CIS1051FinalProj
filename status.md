Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have added the combat system and 4 different enemy types. The game will run until the player dies giving them new encounters after each battle.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have to add graphics to the game as well as add more types of enemies. I also need to implement a system that will allow the player to heal themself as the game is basically impossible to continue after the first fight. I also need to add upgrades for the player.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I am havign trouble getting the game to start without showing the text that appears after you win a battle. I also think that i have two different downloads of VS code that is causing problems with uploading my progress to github.
