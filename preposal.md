# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I am thinking of making a game where the player tries to make it as far as they can before their character dies. I am hoping to make the game randomly generated so the player can play as long as possible without being forced to end their run. The game will be played by having the player input commands such as "attack" or "run". If I have time I would like to implement ASCII art for the different characters the player will encounter. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

n/a

## Do you have any questions of your own?
Are there any resources I could use to learn more about creating these types of games?
Which chapter of the book would best be able to help me with this task?
