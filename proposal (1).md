# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The Dungeon Diver


## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A game where you will play a character making their way through a dungeon in search of treasure. You will encounter enemies along the way that will hinder your progress.


## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will lead the player through the dungeon using input commands from the player. I will be using ren.py to make this game. THe player will be able to use items and upgrade their weapons throughout the game. The software will randomly select things like whether the player faces an enemy or finds a new item. The game will also continue until the player dies or quits. This means that the game will run as long as possible. THe software will alos track the players score as they play the game and return it to them at the end.


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

randomly selected encounters, basic tiems and enemies, long run time if it is too difficult to have the game run endessly,basic graphics, and a score counter to track progress.


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

everything from the good outcome. improved and more complex items and enemies, higher quality graphics, endless run time, enemies drop loot for the player


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Everything from the better outcome. Difficuty scaling with run time (enemy health and damage), item quality scaling with run time.


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My first step is to look into the ren.py software to see how I will be able to use it for this project. I also plan to do research into how python can be used in the context of games as I dont have much experience with that. I will also research game making strategies that will help me design a lot of the features in my game.
